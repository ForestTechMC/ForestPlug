## Why our plug
You maybe now ask "Why i need this plugin?"
- We want to make developing in Java Spigot/Bungee easier to understand, <br>
  and showing some ways how to do some things like APIs.
- If you have some developer team, <br>
  and you need have one plugin for all things, you can use this as main, and have addons in custom addon folder


## Info
